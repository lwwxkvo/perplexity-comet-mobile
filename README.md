# Perplexity's Comet Browser Wants to Replace Chrome on Your Phone

---

You know how your phone came with Chrome already installed, and you just... never changed it? That's exactly the grip Perplexity AI is trying to break. The company behind that AI search engine everyone's been talking about is now building Cometâ€”a browser that doesn't just find stuff, but actually does stuff for you. And they're going straight to Samsung and Motorola to get it pre-loaded on phones before you even unbox them.

Here's what makes this interesting: while Chrome shows you ten blue links, Comet wants to schedule your meetings, summarize articles, and dig through your emails without you lifting a finger. It's the difference between a librarian who points you to books versus one who reads them for you and writes the book report.

## Why This Matters More Than Just Another Browser Launch

Let's be realâ€”nobody wakes up excited about browsers. They're like kitchen sponges. You use whatever's there until it stops working.

But Perplexity just raised $500 million at a $14 billion valuation. Nvidia's backing them. Jeff Bezos wrote a check. Even Eric Schmidtâ€”Google's former CEOâ€”is betting against his old company. That's not "let's build a slightly better Chrome" money. That's "let's fundamentally change how people interact with the internet" money.

The desktop beta of Comet is already live, and it does things that feel weirdly futuristic. Ask it to find a time everyone's free and send a calendar invite? Done. Want a summary of that 3,000-word article you're pretending to read? Here you go. It's like having an assistant who actually knows where you left that email from three weeks ago.



CEO Aravind Srinivas told Reuters they're aiming for "tens to hundreds of millions" of users once they nail the desktop version. That's not startup optimismâ€”that's a land grab.

## The 70% Problem Nobody Talks About

Here's the thing about Chrome: it owns 70% of the mobile browser market. Not because it's wildly better than everything else, but because it's just... there. Safari and Samsung Internet split most of what's left. 

This is what tech people call "stickiness," which is a polite way of saying "people are too lazy to change defaults." And honestly? Fair. Who has time to research browsers?

That's exactly why Perplexity is talking to phone manufacturers instead of begging you to download an app. If Comet ships pre-installed on the next Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Edge, millions of people will use it without ever making a conscious choice. It's the same playbook that made Chrome dominant in the first placeâ€”Google cut deals with device makers, and suddenly Chrome was everywhere.

Srinivas admits it's not easy: "It's not easy to convince mobile OEMs to change the default browser to Comet from Chrome." Translation: Google's contracts are probably pretty sticky themselves.

But here's where it gets interesting. Bloomberg reported back in June that Perplexity is also talking to Samsung and Apple about integrating its AI search into Bixby and Siri. Imagine asking Siri a question and getting an actual useful answer instead of "Here's what I found on the web." That's the pitch.

## What Makes Comet Different (And Why You Might Actually Care)

Most browsers are basically fancy address bars with bookmarks. You type something, you get results, you click around. Comet is trying to be what tech people call "agentic AI"â€”software that acts on your behalf instead of just fetching information.

Right now in beta, Comet can:
- Pull information from your emails, calendar, and browsing history
- Answer questions about your own data ("When's my next dentist appointment?")
- Summarize web pages without you reading them
- Schedule meetings by checking everyone's availability

It's the difference between asking "What's the weather?" and having your umbrella already by the door.

OpenAI is reportedly building something similarâ€”a browser that could book your flights and manage your finances. So this isn't just Perplexity being ambitious. This is the entire AI industry realizing that search engines are about to become personal assistants.

## The Real Question: Will Anyone Actually Switch?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: most people don't care about browsers. They care about whether stuff loads fast and doesn't break.

Chrome works. It syncs across devices. Your passwords are saved. Your extensions are installed. Switching means rebuilding all of that, and for what? Slightly better AI features you might use twice a month?

That's why the OEM strategy is smart. If Comet is already there when you turn on your new phone, you don't have to switchâ€”you just start using it. No migration headaches. No "where did my bookmarks go?" panic.

But there's a catch: Google pays Apple billions of dollars every year to keep Google Search as the default on iPhones. Those kinds of deals don't just disappear because a startup has a cool AI feature. Perplexity needs to either outbid Google (unlikely) or convince manufacturers that AI-first browsing is the future (possible).

The company's betting that "agentic AI" is compelling enough to break through. That instead of searching for restaurants, you'll just tell Comet "find a place for dinner Friday that takes reservations and isn't Italian," and it'll handle everything.

Maybe. Or maybe people will keep using Chrome because it's fine and they don't think about browsers.

## What Happens Next

Perplexity is targeting a full mobile launch once the desktop version stabilizes. If they can actually land deals with Samsung or Motorola, Comet could be on tens of millions of devices within a year.

That's a big "if." Google didn't build Chrome's dominance by accidentâ€”they spent years and billions of dollars making it the default everywhere. Breaking that grip requires either massive distribution deals or a feature so good that people actively seek it out.

Right now, Comet has the backing, the technology, and the timing. AI is hot. People are curious. And Google's been looking vulnerable ever since ChatGPT made everyone realize search could work differently.

But curiosity doesn't always translate to behavior change. We'll see if "AI that does things for you" is enough to make people rethink the browser they've been ignoring for years.
